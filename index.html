            <h2>Why Lady Gaga?</h2>
            <h3>Why is Lady Gaga my favorite singer?</h3>
            <p>
              Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, known professionally as Lady
              Gaga, is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She is known
              for her image reinventions and musical versatility. Gaga began
              performing as a teenager, singing at open mic nights and acting in
              school plays. She studied at Collaborative Arts Project 21,
              through the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, before
              dropping out to pursue a career in music. After Def Jam Recordings
              canceled her contract, she worked as a songwriter for Sony/ATV
              Music Publishing, where she signed a joint deal with Interscope
              Records and KonLive Distribution, in 2007. Gaga had her
              breakthrough the following year with her debut studio album, The
              Fame, and its chart-topping singles "Just Dance" and "Poker Face".
              The album was later reissued to include the extended play The Fame
              Monster (2009), which yielded the successful singles "Bad
              Romance", "Telephone", and "Alejandro".

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              Hi! My name is Luana Lima, I'm originally from Brazil, but now I'm
              based in Portugal. I graduated in architecture and urban design,
              but recently I started to learn code. Since then, I haven't
              stopped and I'm excited to keep learning and perhaps start a new
              career in information technology.
