            <h2>Why Lady Gaga?</h2>
            <h3>Why is Lady Gaga my favorite singer?</h3>
            <p>
              Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, known professionally as Lady
              Gaga, is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She is known
              for her image reinventions and musical versatility. Gaga began
              performing as a teenager, singing at open mic nights and acting in
              school plays. She studied at Collaborative Arts Project 21,
              through the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, before
              dropping out to pursue a career in music. After Def Jam Recordings
              canceled her contract, she worked as a songwriter for Sony/ATV
              Music Publishing, where she signed a joint deal with Interscope
              Records and KonLive Distribution, in 2007. Gaga had her
              breakthrough the following year with her debut studio album, The
              Fame, and its chart-topping singles "Just Dance" and "Poker Face".
              The album was later reissued to include the extended play The Fame
              Monster (2009), which yielded the successful singles "Bad
              Romance", "Telephone", and "Alejandro".

                <h4>911</h4>
                <p>
                  '911' is a song recorded for her sixth studio album,
                  Chromatica (2020). It is preceded by a string arrangement
                  titled "Chromatica II". It is a Eurodisco, synth-pop, and
                  electropop song with influences from funk and techno.
                  Lyrically, it talks about mental health and the antipsychotic
                  medication Gaga takes.

                <h4>Alejandro</h4>
                <p>
                  'Alejandro' is a song recorded for her EP, The Fame Monster
                  (2009). A synth-pop track with Europop and Latin pop beats, it
                  opens with a sample from Vittorio Monti's "Csárdás". The song
                  was inspired by Gaga's fear of men and is about her bidding
                  farewell to her Latino lovers named Alejandro, Roberto and
                  Fernando.

              but recently I started to learn code. Since then, I haven't
              stopped and I'm excited to keep learning and perhaps start a new
